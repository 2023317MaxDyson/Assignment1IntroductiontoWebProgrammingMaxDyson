<p> <b> About me: </b> I am a student at Bow Valley College who is studying for the Software Development program in the winter term. </br>
  I have learned so many computer languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL Server, C++ and C#. </br> Why I chose this program is because I want to know 
  how to create <b> mobile apps </b> and create <b> websites </b> by learning different computer languages. </br> I grew up in Canada but I was born in Scotland 
  because both of my parents grew up in Scotland (United Kingdom, Europe).
   </p>

</br>
  <p> <b> About the image: </b> This image is the logo for the Scotland Nationial Team. </br> In Europe soccer is called football which is one of the most popular sports.</br>
    I started watching soccer when my dad conviced me to watch the <b> Euros 2020 </b> (Europe Nationial Team Competition), which is one the big competetions in nationial soccer. </br> Scotland has not been to a 
    <b> Fifa World Cup </b> for a long time since 1998 and the <b> Euros </b> since 1996, but they have qualified for the Euros 2020 which is a big acheivement. </br> Scotland only drew against England and lost
    to Czech Republic and Croatia in the group stage which knocks out Scotland in the Euro's. </br>  </br> </br> </br> Scotland Nationial FC has great soccer players like: </br> </br> Scott McTominay ( Soccer Club: Manchester United FC (England)) , </br> Andrew Robertson (Soccer Club: Liverpool FC (England)), </br>
    Kieran Tierney (Soccer Club: Real Sociedad (Spain), </br> John McGinn (Soccer Club: Aston Villa (England)), </br> Billy Gilmour (Soccer Club: Brighton and Hove Albion FC (England)) and  </br> Aaron Hickey ( Soccer Club: Brentford FC (England)) etc.
